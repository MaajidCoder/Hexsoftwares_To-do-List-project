## File Structure

```
to-do-list/
├── index.html      # Main HTML structure
├── style.css       # Styling and layout
├── script.js       # Application logic and functionality
├── .gitignore      # Git ignore file
└── README.md       # This file
```

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup
- **CSS3** - Flexbox, gradients, transitions, and animations
- **JavaScript (ES6)** - Class-based architecture with localStorage API

## How It Works

The application uses a `TodoApp` class to manage:
- Task creation and deletion
- Task completion status
- Filtering functionality
- Local storage persistence
- DOM rendering

All tasks are automatically saved to the browser's localStorage, so your tasks are preserved even after closing the browser.

## Browser Support

Works on all modern browsers:
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 11+
- Edge 79+

## Future Enhancements

- Add due dates and reminders
- Implement categories/tags
- Add dark mode
- Export/import tasks
- Task priority levels
- Edit existing tasks
